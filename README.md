Weather Mingle is a MERN-stack web application designed to display the current weather conditions, temperature and the five day weather forecast for the user's retrieved coordinates. The user is able to create an account, or login if an account is already created. Depending upon the weather conditions will dynamically change the color scheme and background on the user's screen of the overall application. Additionally, any user that is logged in can chat with one another about the weather!

The deployed web application can be found [here](https://weather-mingle-c946f1cbd590.herokuapp.com/login).
